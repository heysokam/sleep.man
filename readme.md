This application is a sleep tracking and visualization tool specialized for people with non-24-hour sleep-wake disorders and unorthodox sleep schedules.  
It creates a visual representation of sleep patterns over time.  

The core functionality includes visualizing sleep patterns through a bar chart.  
Each sleep period is represented as a block displaying sleep metrics such as average sleep duration and sleep onset drift.  
It also provides prediction of future sleep patterns based on historical data.  

The application is particularly focused on supporting non-24-hour sleep-wake cycles by:
- Tracking the progressive drift in sleep times
- Calculating cycle length
- Visualizing how sleep patterns shift over time

Additional features include:
- Multi-timezone display (EU, NY, LA)
- Trend line visualization for consecutive sleep and wake times
- Tooltips showing sleep metrics

The minimalist design prioritizes data visualization with configurable elements.
